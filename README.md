## 🔍 Understanding the Error Handling Patterns

### ⚡ Using Exceptions

Exceptions are a traditional way to manage errors in programming. This project exemplifies how to throw, catch, and manage exceptions effectively within C# applications. 

### 📦 Result Pattern

The Result Pattern offers a more modern approach. It returns an object that indicates success or failure instead of throwing exceptions. This method can make your code cleaner and easier to understand.
